# Locomotion
A Logic World mod that adds movement to the game

Pistons, while super neat to look at

Are still VERY buggy.

Feel free to play around with them.  They won't corrupt your world or anything

But don't be surprised if they do some... stuff

Player detector, as far as I tested, is fully functioning and should be good to go.  Enjoy :D

Integrated Circuit, it's really just a self sizing box that culls renderers and colliders.
You can colorize it too :D
